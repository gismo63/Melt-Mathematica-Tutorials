# Melt-Mathematica-Tutorials
Some tutorials that I made and presented on using the Melt package for Wolfram Mathematica.

The tutorials were delivered at the group meeting of the CATS group at the School of Physics, University College Dublin in January 2023. Youtube videos of the live pressentations are available on Youtube:
